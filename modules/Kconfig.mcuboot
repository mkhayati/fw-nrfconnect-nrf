	  Sign images for MCUBoot as integrated part of the build stages using
	  the private key.

config BOOT_SIGNATURE_KEY_FILE
	string "MCUBoot PEM key file"
	depends on !MCUBOOT_BUILD_STRATEGY_FROM_SOURCE
	help
	  Absolute path to PEM key file containing the private key corresponding
	  to the public key included in MCUBoot. This will be used to sign the
	  image so that it can be verified by MCUBoot. Since MCUBoot is not
	  built from source, it is not possible for the build system to deduce
	  what key was used when compiling it. Hence, it is required that the
	  key is passed to the build system through this option.

config INIT_ARCH_HW_AT_BOOT
	default n if SPM
	default y
	help
	  The image will be booted directly by an unknown image which might not
	  leave the system in a clean state, so it is necessary to perform
	  architecture specific hardware initialization.
